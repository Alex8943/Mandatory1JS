    <h1> What is SSR ?</h1>
    <div class="newspaper"> 
        Server-side rendering (SSR) is a method of loading your website’s JavaScript on your own server. 
        When human users or search engine web crawlers like Googlebot request a page, the content reads as a static HTML page.

        Historically, search engines have had difficulty crawling and indexing websites made using JavaScript rather than HTML.

        Websites built with front-end JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React, or Vue all default to CSR. 
        This is problematic from an SEO standpoint because when web crawlers encounter a page on your website, all they see is a blank screen

        Server-side rendering, meanwhile, is the more traditional option; it’s buying the groceries and cooking the meal yourself. 
        It loads your JavaScript content on your website’s server.

        SSR dates back to the time when JavaScript and PHP were primarily backend technologies, 
        and Java was used simply to make HTML-based websites more interactive rather than building them from scratch.
        
        SSR converts your HTML files into information that’s readable for the user-end browser. Googlebot can see the basic HTML content on your web page without JavaScript in the way, while the user sees the fully-rendered page in all its glory. 
        Your website is ranked properly on Google, and your user is treated to a web experience that’s a feast for the eyes and ears.
