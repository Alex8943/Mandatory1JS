    <h1> What is a callback function </h1>

    <div class="newspaper">
        A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.
        they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're completed, as you're probably used to. 
        Instead, it will execute in the background while the rest of the code runs.
